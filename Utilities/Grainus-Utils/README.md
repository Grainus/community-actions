This script contains multiple general utility functions that can be integrated into other actions. It offers multiple functions that mirror built-in functions from the Python language. It also offers a few quality of life functions and shortcuts to make actions more readable.

For more information on the possible arguments and examples for the python functions, see [this reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).

The functions are not meant to be used individually: they are meant to all be imported as a script. For this reason, some functions can depend on others to work. Such dependencies are disclaimed in the comments.
